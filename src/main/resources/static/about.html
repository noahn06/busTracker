        My name is Noah Nguyen and I am a sophomore studying computer engineering at
        the University of Washington.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a webpage that I built that uses the OneBusAway RESTful API and gathers the
        data for the bus route 45 at stop 1_38024 which is the bus that I take everyday to
        get to and from school everyday at the University of Washington.
      </p>

      <p>
        I built Bus Tracker to get me to school on time more often, being able to open a website
        of the exact stop I need every morning with the next arrivals allows me to know when I
        need to leave the house without the burden and added time of navigating through a public
        transportation app is a huge time-saver for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The implementation of Bus Tracker has allowed me to reduce the amount of missed busses
        I have in the morning as well as getting me to classes more on time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The web application is easily scalable to support multiple stops, routes and arrival
        feeds.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was my first ever project that I have done outside of class and it taught me tons
        about full-stack development. I learned how to make HTTP requests, worked with my first
        API ever, got to parse and process the data the API gave me to display.
